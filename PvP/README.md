Need to keep a list of legal moves for each piece.
Need to keep track of pinned pieces and squares the other player is attacking.

Going to try to use Qt for GUI purposes

V2 list:
Pieces need to be represented by numbers. I can worry about size and optimisation later, just start with the board being a vector of ints.
