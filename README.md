Chess Project based off of the two Sebastein Lague youtube videos on creating a chess bot. Intended as a long term project, I'm just looking for it to work initially, and intend to
be optimising it for a long time. Created a 2 player program first, before implementing search and evaulation functions to turn it into a bot.




Notes:
Going to try to use Qt for GUI purposes, until then I am using unicode chess figures in the terminal

List to do:
Need game history for three fold repetition rule
FENstring halfmove clock and fullmove number, implement these and the rules
Game History is big on data so need to implement zobrist hashing to keep track of gamestates
